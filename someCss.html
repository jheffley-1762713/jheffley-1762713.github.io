        Bow Down to Washington,
        Bow Down to Washington,
        Mighty Are The Men
        Who Wear the Purple and the Gold,
        Joyfully We Welcome Them
        Within the Victors Fold.
        We Will Carve Their Names
        In the Hall of Fame
        To Preserve the Memory of Our Devotion.
        Heaven Help the Foes of Washington;
        They're Trembling at the Feet
        Of Mighty Washington,
        The Boys Are There With Bells,
        Their Fighting Blood Excels,
        It's Harder to Push Them Over the Line
        Than Pass the Dardanelles.
        Victory the Cry of Washington...
        Leather Lungs Together
        With a Rah! Rah! Rah!
        And O'er the Land
        Our Loyal Band
        Will Sing the Glory
        Of Washington Forever.
